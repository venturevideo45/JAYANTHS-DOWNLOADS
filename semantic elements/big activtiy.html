The Koenigsegg Jesko is a Swedish hypercar introduced in 2019 as the successor to the
 Agera series, named after Jesko von Koenigsegg, the father of company founder Christian
  von Koenigsegg. Built around a carbon-fiber monocoque chassis, the Jesko is powered by 
  a 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine producing up to 1,600 hp on E85 fuel and paired with 
  a revolutionary 9-speed Light Speed Transmission that delivers lightning-fast gear shifts.
   Designed for both track and speed performance, it comes in two versions — the Jesko Attack, 
   optimized for downforce and handling, and the Jesko Absolut, engineered for top speed with a 
   more aerodynamic body. Advanced features like active rear-wheel steering, Triplex suspension
   , and active aerodynamics make it one of the most technologically sophisticated cars ever built.
    With production limited to 125 units, the Jesko combines extreme power, cutting-edge engineering, and
 exclusivity — pushing the boundaries of whats possible in automotive performance.
